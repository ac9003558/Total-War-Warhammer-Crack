| **Skaven**           | Ratmen with overwhelming numbers and devious weapons    |
| **Lizardmen**        | Ancient, dinosaur-riding warriors of the jungles        |
| **Tomb Kings**       | Undead pharaohs with constructs and cursed legions      |
| **Wood Elves**       | Guerrilla archers and magical treefolk                  |
| **Daemons of Chaos** | The embodiment of the Chaos Gods                        |

Each faction has **legendary lords** with personal quests, custom units, and campaign mechanics that deeply change gameplay.

### **Total War: Warhammer Trilogy**

| Game              | Released | Focus                                                |

‚úÖ Unique heroes, monsters, and spells
‚úÖ A living world with narrative-driven chaos and magic

---
